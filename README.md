# EQUILIBRATE
## Ethical, Quantified, User-Influenced Balanced Rating Algorithm for Trust Evaluation.

EQUILIBRATE is a dynamic, fair, and tamper-resistant star rating algorithm designed for social platforms and corporate environments. It combines weighted user influence, progressive difficulty scaling, and time-based rating decay to ensure trust scores evolve organically over time. With integrated NLP-powered sentiment analysis, the system automatically interprets comment feedback as positive or negative, reducing bias and manual moderation overhead. Built-in anti-gaming safeguards—including interaction cooldowns, rating diversity checks, and Sybil attack prevention—make the algorithm resilient against manipulation. EQUILIBRATE empowers communities and organizations to highlight genuine quality, reward ethical behavior, and maintain transparent trust metrics.
